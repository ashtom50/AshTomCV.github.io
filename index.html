													<h1>DSSC Final Year Project</h1>
													<div class="blog-detail">Project</div>
													<div class="blog-content">
														<ul class="list-style">
															<li>Fabricate Dye Sensitized Solar Cell using Natural Dyes </li>
															<li>Investigate a variety of different dyes and their effects on cell efficiency </li>
															<li>Develop cosensitized cells by mixing compatible dyes and comparing their performance </li>
														</ul>
														<p>
															For my final year project of my BSc Physics degree, I fabricated solar cells using natural dyes extracted from plants, fruits and vegetables.
															The motivation being the project was to investigate alternative methods for solar power generation which don't involve conventional silicon as this can be difficult to recycle at end of use.

														</p>
														<h2>
															Benchmarking a silicon cell
														</h2>
														<p>
															To test the cells that we would be making, a light box was setup.
															A standard silicon cell was then tested to get an understanding of how much power could reasonably be harnessed from the light source and to give a benchmark to compare results against.
															Initially the testing of cells was done using a separate voltmeter and ammeter to record the I-V curve created by the cell.
															This was found to be very inefficient and was difficult to reliably repeat, so I setup a test circuit with an Arduino to record the result. 
															The Arduino project can be seen in detail here, <a href="#popup-14" class="name has-popup-media" >Arduino Multimeter </a>
														</p>
														<h2>
															Extracting the Dyes
														</h2>
														<p>
															The dyes were extracted from a range of plants, fruits and vegetables all based on success in previous research. 
															The exact extraction method had to vary slightly based on the source of the dye but the base principle involved crushing the source in either water or ethanol and then filtering the solution.

														</p>
														<h2>
															Analyzing the Dye
														</h2>
														<p>
															With the dye extracted it was then watered down and analyzed using a spectrometer.
															This allowed us to see the absorption of the dye over a range of wavelengths.
															The absorption of the dye in the wavelengths of the sun are one of the most important properties of the dye so testing this at an early stage helped us rule out certain dye sources without making cells for them.

														</p>
														<h2>
															Making the Cells
														</h2>
														<p>
															To make the cells, a Titanium dioxide paste was made, and spread thinly onto a sheet of conductive glass. 
															The cell was then heated on a hotplate and left to cool.
															The extracted dye was then carefully dropped onto the Ti02 with a pipet and left to soak in.
															The excess dye could then be rinsed off and the cell is left to dry.
															Finally a small amount of redox electrolyte solution is sandwiched between the Ti02 layer and another sheet of conductive glass, and the pieces are clamped together.
														</p>
														<h2>
															Testing the Cells
														</h2>
														<p>
															With the cells made they are then tested in the same setup as the initial silicon cell.

														<ul class="list-style">
															<li>Arduino and breakout boards used to measure current and voltage. </li>
															<li>Data sent directly to excel for easy analysis. </li>
															<li>Low cost solution for improved multimeter data collection. </li>
														</ul>
														
														<h2>
															Why?
														</h2>
														<p>
															A part of my final year project of my BSc Physics degree, I needed to test the efficiency of solar cells.
															The conventional method of testing was to use two multimeters with one testing the voltage and another the current.
															The resistance was then altered using a manual potentiometer and the current and voltage recorded to eventually plot an I-V curve.
															This method had several issues that I wanted to address,
														</p>
														<ul class="list-style">
															<li>Data collection was very slow </li>
															<li>Manual adjustment of potentiometer was inconsistent </li>
															<li>Number of resistance steps was inconsistent </li>
														</ul>
														<p>
															At this point a python script was tested to try and read the data from the multimeters but communication errors, software licensing and installation restrictions on university computers meant I needed to look for an alternative method.
														</p>
														<center><img src="images/Projects/Multimeter.jpg" alt="Multimeter" style = "width:50%"></center>
														<h2>
															Solution
														</h2>
														<p>
															I soon realized that automating this task would make results more consistent and regardless of the testing time would free up my time in the lab for other jobs.
															My first priority was to automate the potentiometer as this would at least make the results more consistent.
															I originally considered using a motor to turn the manual potentiometer a set amount before I later discovered digital potentiometers.
															The board used was a DS3502 by Adafruit, which had example libraries in the Arduino IDE and was simple to control with I2C.
															With the resistance now changing by one step every few seconds it was realized that I would now need to quickly take a measurement inbetween steps.
															The INA219 board was then purchased to measure the current and voltage output from the cells automatically.
															It was then simple to create a script that would print current and voltage readings, reduce the resistance and then repeat.
															The final step was to add a simple Excel integration which sent the data directly to a spreadsheet ready to be graphed.

														</ul>
														<p>
															I recently made an eink display that shows my to do list from the Todoist app. I purchased a 4.2-
															inch Waveshare eink display and used a Pi zero W to control it. I started with the sample python code provided by
															Waveshare to test the screen. As I understood more of the code, I cut more and more of it down until I had only the
															bare essentials that I could use as a starting point. From the Todoist documentation I used their rest API to download
															my current to do list and filter them down to just todays and overdue tasks. These are then displayed on the screen
															alongside their due dates. Once all the tasks are completed the screen then shows my tasks for the next seven days. I
															am now making a 3D printed case, adding a power button and wiring the Pi to the back of the screen directly for a
															clean finished product.
														</p>
														<h2>
															Future
														</h2>
														<p>
															I would like to improve my code further by looking for ways to make it more efficient.
															It would be good to try and move the controller from the Pi Zero 2 W to the newly released Pico W as this will use less power and will remove the reliance on the SD card.

															<li>Write a python script to check product prices</li>
															<li>Send an email when the price drops below a target</li>
															<li>Create an cron job on a raspberry pi to run the script periodically</li>
														</ul>
														<h2>
															Why?
														</h2>
														<p>
															After getting fed up with the number of plastic bottles we were throwing in the bin each week, we decided 
															to buy a Sodastream. This allows us to use CO2 canisters and syrup to make our own fizzy drinks. The downside 
															to this approach is that I am somewhat locked into to buying my syrups directly from Sodastream which can 
															be a little pricey. As we mostly just buy their pepsi max, and the price does randomly drop, I decided to 
															come up with a way to monitor the price and alert me when its the best time to buy.
														</p>
														<h2>
															Scraper
														</h2>
														<p>
															To make my scraper I quickly decided I wanted it to be python based (my preferred language) and to work 
															on a Raspberry Pi, as I already have several that are always running. After a bit of research I found the 
															BeautifulSoup and requests packages, which allow me to download and search for components in HTML files. 
															I then analyzed the Sodastream using chromes dev tools and found the section with the price. I was now 
															able to download the current price directly from their website.
														</p>
														<h2>
															Email Notifications
														</h2>
														<p>
															A basic check was setup on the scrapped number to compare it to a target number lower than the current 
															price. Using the python packages email and smtplib, I then sent myself an email notifying me that the
															price had dropped to a suitable value.
														</p>
														<center><img src="images/Projects/Scraper Email.jpg" alt="what image shows" style = "width:50%"></center>
														<h2>
															Running the script
														</h2>
														<p>
															To run the script at regular intervals, I copied it over to my Raspberry Pi 4 running Home Assistant.
															After installing the required packages and testing the script worked I added a task to the cron file
															to run the script every hour.
														</p>
														<h2>
															Future
														</h2>
														<p>
															With the work now done I plan on using this script to scrape other websites to keep an eye out for the best deals.

													<h1>PLEX Media Server</h1>
													<div class="blog-detail">Personal</div>
													<div class="blog-content">
														<ul class="list-style">
															<li>Setup a Raspberry Pi 4 as a Plex media server.</li>
															<li>Designed and 3D printed an enclosure.</li>
															<li>Added a power button and a temperature controlled cooling fan.</li>
														</ul>
														<h2>
															Why Bother?
														</h2>
														<p>
															Like many people I have a huge collection of old DVDs and some Blu-Rays from the days before streaming. 
															Now that we can watch a huge selection of films and TV shows on Netflix by 
															simply navigating the TV with a remote, DVDs have become inconvenient.
														</p>
														<p>
															To solve this I began the long and slow process of ripping my disks to my PCs hard drive, and then 
															copied across a collection of them to a USB drive connected to my router. This gave me easy access 
															to a small selection of my content using Kodi anywhere in my house I could get the app. While this 
															proved the concept worked, I have a few terabytes of media and so a USB drive severely restricted 
															the amount of content I had easy access too.
														</p>
														<h2>
															Plex
														</h2>
														<p>
															Plex allows its users to host their own server with their own content just like a personal Netflix. 
															I installed Plex on a Raspberry Pi4 as it is powerful enough to transcode 720p video, which is 
															beyond DVD quality and is very low power, making me feel less guilty about leaving it on all the time. 
															OpenMediaVault was installed initially to setup the two external hard drives that I would be storing 
															my content on. The custom Raspberry Pi installation of Plex was then setup and configured to look to 
															one of my hard drives for movies and the other for TV.
														</p>
														<p>
															The Pi and the two hard drives were initially just sat on a shelf in the open but I wanted the mess 
															of wires to be a bit neater and the Pi protected. I then decided to house everything inside the shell 
															of an old DVD player that no longer worked, although the lack of ventilation meant that just heavy work 
															loads both the Pi and the HDDs were getting much hotter than I liked. One afternoon I decided that it 
															was time to design and build a custom case to hold everything with cooling in mind. I settled on a 
															vertical design with a fan flowing onto the ends of all 3 main components. This allows for excellent 
															airflow into the case, with slots on the sides and holed text on the top to vent out hot air. The 
															printing took 24 hours on my Ender 3 and the components fit perfectly. The only issue encountered was 
															that my powered USB hub that the case was designed to hold decided to fail as I was setting everything 
															up. Rather than go for another cheap unknown brand I opted for a Sabrent model that didn't fit as nicely 
															but I felt would be more reliable.
														</p>
														<p>
															With everything back up and running as before it was time to add a power button for easy shutdowns when 
															not needed and a temperature controlled fan. The power button was connected up to GPIO pins 5 and 6 and 
															takes advantage of the Pi 4s ability to wake when these two pins are shorted. A python script in the Cron 
															Tab, ran at startup, ensured that a simple shutdown command was issued when the button was pressed during 
															normal operation. This ensured that the Pi is always shutdown correctly and helps avoid SD card corruption. 
															The fan was connected up with a transistor and another python script was used to turn the fan on when 
															temperatures reach 55 degrees and and turn it back off when cooled to 45 degrees. This keeps temperatures 
															under control without having a fan whirling all day long.
														</p>
														<h2>
															Future
														</h2>
														<p>
															The long term goal for this project is to buy a more powerful NAS that I can fit multiple 3.5 HDDs into. 
															This would allow me cheaper storage to setup a raid configuration to better to protect my data. The 
															improved power will help with 4K playback which is a bit beyond the capabilities of the little Raspberry Pi.

													<div class="blog-detail">Personal</div>

														<ul class="list-style">
															<li>Investigate electronics and 3D printing technology </li>
															<li>Create custom enclosures and other parts for Raspberry Pi projects </li>
															<li>Create useful DIY home repairs and improvements </li>
														</ul>
														
														<p>
															I decided to buy the base model Creality Ender 3 during the first COVID 19 lockdown. 
															The Ender 3 was chosen for its low price and popularity, making it easy to source help from a wide community to get me started.
															I immediately purchased some base upgrades to get me started such as a metal extruder and improved bed springs.

														</p>
														<h2>
															Octoprint
														</h2>
														<p>
															The standard method for getting print files onto the printer is by inserting an SD card.
															While this isn't so bad when your PC and the printer are next to each other, it does become very inconvenient if you would like to setup the printer in another room.
															The solution to this was Octoprint, a custom OS installed on a Raspberry Pi. 
															Octoprint connects to the printer over USB and allows me to control the printer remotely, including monitoring its current state and sending print files to it directly over the network.
															When coupled with a small camera, this allows me full control and monitoring of the printer from start to finish.

														</p>
														<h2>
															RGB Lighting
														</h2>
														<p>
															I moved my printer to a cupboard for better climate control while printing.
															The downside of this was the cupboard did not have any lighting and so the camera became useless.
															Seeing the opportunity for an upgrade I decided to buy a new mainboard with Neopixel headers.
															This allowed me to make some minor firmware changes and connect a strip of three Neopixels to the underside of the print head.
															These illuminate the print bed and show the status of the printer through different colours with red using while heating the print bed and nozzle, while while printing, and green when printing is complete.

														</p>
														<h2>
															Laser Module
														</h2>
														<p>
															With a 3D printer being able to move over a surface with given X-Y coordinates theres no reason it can't be converted into a laser engraver.
															I purchased a small laser and 3D printed a holder for it to attach onto the side of the print head. 
															To power the laser I took advantage of the printers part cooling fan which uses PWM.
															The fan wire was put through a switch to control whether power was sent to the fan or the laser, effectively giving me a print mode and a laser mode.
															A website was used to convert an image into the required G-code the printer recognized and I was now able to laser engrave wood with my 3D printer.

														<p>
															Short term improvements I would like to make to the printer are an upgraded camera for improved picture quality and a second lighting strip to better illuminate the whole print bed.

													<h1>Smart Hornby Train </h1>
													<div class="blog-detail">Personal</div>
													<div class="blog-content">
														<ul class="list-style">
															<li>Learning how to integrate electronics with IOT </li>
															<li>Experiment with basic motor control </li>
															<li>Setup an automated train that will eventually go around a Christmas tree based on smart home parameters. </li>
														</ul>
														
														<p>
															During Covid I purchased a cheap second hand Hornby train set from Facebook Marketplace.
															After spending a surprisingly long time sanding rust off the tops of the tracks I was able to get the old train running again.
															These old analogue train sets work by connecting a power supply to the tracks and varying the PWM.
															This varied power causes the motor in the train to run faster or slower.
															This made me wonder how difficult it would be to setup a WIFI enabled micro controller to control the power to the tracks, thus enabling me to control the train both from my phone and to even become a part of my smart home.


														</p>
														<h2>
															Motor Control
														</h2>
														<p>
															The microcontroller chosen was the ESP8266 due to its low cost, simple integration into home assistant and built in WIFI.
															This was connected to a L298N motor controller, an IR sensor gate and a Neopixel light strip.
															Everything was then mounted underneath the train tunnel to hide the wiring from view.

														</p>

														<center><img src="images/Projects/Tunnel underside.jpg" alt="what image shows" style = "width:50%"></center>


														<h2>
															ESPHome
														</h2>
														<p>
															The ESP microcontroller was then flashed with ESPHome and added to home assistant.
															The code was written in yaml to utilize the IR gate to detect when the train had passed through.
															This allowed me to count the number of laps and with some careful timing meant I could make the train automatically stop at the station.
															The motor controllers were set as a gradual 1-10 scale going forwards and a simple on/off reverse button.
															Finally control of the Neopixel strip was added.
															This was further synced with the IR gate to allow the lights to be turned on as the train enters the tunnel.

														</p>
														<h2>
															Smart Home Integration
														</h2>
														<p>
															With the train now fully controllable from within home assistant the control was expanded to google assistant.
															Since I already had google connected to my home assistant server I simply needed to add the configuration to expose the new controls.
															This allowed me to turn the train on/off with voice commands through my google home mini speakers.

														</p>

														<h2>
															Future
														</h2>
														<p>
															The core functionality of this project is completed with everything I wanted to achieve being successful.
															Future improvements would be expanding the train control functionality and adding another sensor to make stopping at the station simpler and more reliable at different speeds.

														<p>
															For a few years now I have run OpenMediaVault, Plex and Home Assistant across two Raspberry Pi 4's.
															This was a brilliant starting point to get access to these platforms but when Plex starts to struggle with transcoding, and Home assistant starts to strugggle with multiple cameras its time to look at hardware upgrades.
														</p>
														<h2>
															Choosing the Hardware
														</h2>
														<p>
															Mini PCs had been on my radar for a while for there small form factor and their low current draw.
															A lot of reviews pointed me towards the Intel N100 processor as being suitible for Plex and being easily compatible for Plex and Intel quick sync transcoding.
															With the N100 having 4 cores and a low price tag it seemed a good starting point into virtualizing my setup.
															An early consideration was to build a full size server PC that could hold multi 3.5 inch hard drives for Plex media storage.
															This plan was eventually dropped due to the high upfront cost and the increased power consumption.
															The mini PC is not suitable for hosting the media itself so it will be purely the brains while a dedicated NAS will be used in the future to add the storage.
